# MoonlitCipher

**MoonlitCipher** is a Capture The Flag (CTF) team that thrives in low-visibility problems—  
where intent is obscured, signals are faint, and precision matters most.

We focus on disciplined, methodical analysis across core offensive and investigative domains:

- Cryptography  
- Web Exploitation  
- Reverse Engineering  
- Binary Exploitation (Pwn)  
- Digital Forensics  
- OSINT  

Our philosophy values **quiet rigor, collaboration, and mastery over noise**.  
We solve challenges not through brute force, but by *reading what others overlook*.

## Team Ethos

- Precision over speed  
- Understanding over guessing  
- Signal extraction in hostile noise  
- Learning through failure, refining through discipline  

MoonlitCipher operates where clarity is scarce—and that’s where we are strongest.
